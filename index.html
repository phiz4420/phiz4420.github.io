				<h3>Kung Fu Tea Instructional Poster</h3>

				<h3>Witches Movieposters</h3>
				<p>I have a nice group photo of girls from my workplace. I think it would be fun to spice it up with a magic theme. The bright color poster fits well during summer, but I want a darker, and gloomier version of the poster. So I make the second poster with a horror movie color palette.</p>
